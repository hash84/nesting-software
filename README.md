# nesting-software
a shape fitting problem solution

The aim of this project is to fit as maximum number of shapes in minimum area to reduce material wastage.
Language used: Python 2.7.3(num.py, graphics.py)
>Algorithms used:
>
>>There were a number of algorithms available for executing this task but implementing them was not possible due to high complexity 
>
>>Due this reason, we developed a technique which is not highly efficient but when compared to random cutting or placing of shapes is more effecient
>
>>Due to high complexity the program was only developed for optimizing rectangular shapes

Output of the program:
